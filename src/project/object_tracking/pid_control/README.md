# PID control
This package contains some basic commands to help you learn the basics of using ROS.

If you want to try it in the simulator, make sure Gazebo is enabled and the sensor is on.
```
ros2 launch scout_simulation simulation.launch.py # Completed
ros2 launch run_sensor object_tracking_sensor.launch.py # Completed

ros2 launch pid_control pid_control.launch.launch.py # To do
```

1. setup parameters

2. setup pub and sub

3. get velocity from PID_Control

4. check if velocity is out of range 

5. pub velocity

⭐ Don't plagiarize, this is to confirm that you understand the basic knowledge of ros.⭐
